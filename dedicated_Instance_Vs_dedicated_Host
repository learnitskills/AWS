Dedicated Instance does not work like this. Your instance runs on some dedicated hardware.
Its not lockdown to you. If you stop/start instance, you can get some other hardware somewhere else. 
Basically, the hardware is "yours" (you are not sharing it with others) for the time your instance is running. 
You stop/start it, you may get different physical machine later on (maybe older, maybe newer, maybe its specs will be a bit different), and so on. 
So your instance is moved around on different physical servers - whichever is not occupied by others at the time.
With Dedicated Host the physical server is basically yours. It does not change, it's always the same physical machine for as long as you are paying.



Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer.
Dedicated Instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not Dedicated Instances.



Dedicated Host.
You pay hourly for a single physical host based on instance type, which can then hold a certain number of instances. 
Pricing is based on the instance size.



Each Dedicated Host must run the same instance type and instance size.(no mixing and matching within a single Dedicated Host - not even different instance sizes of the same family)
For example, if you are using the C3 instance family, you must pay hourly for an entire physical C3 host that can launch up to 16 c3.large instances, 8 c3.xlarge instances, etc.


Use Dedicated Hosts for more visibility into the physical host for BYOL. You should also try Dedicated Hosts if your app requires minimal latency between instances.
